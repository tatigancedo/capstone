          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>The Miami History Guide is a guide that talks about the history of Miami, Florida's neighborhoods. It focuses on the people and places that contributed to its growth. Miami is nicknamed the Magic City because of how fast it grew. It continues to grow with 54% of residents born outside of the U.S. in 2022.</p>
